## Development Setup

We use JDK 17.0.6 as SDK and Kotlin 1.8.21 as project language.

We use Gradle Kotlin DSL as build system.

To run a test server with the plugin, you can use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew clean runServer
```

## Code Formatting

We use IntelliJ's Kotlin style guide for code formatting.

Using IntelliJ IDEA will make this task much easier.
